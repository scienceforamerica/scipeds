    "First things first: `scipeds` is all about IPEDS data. While IPEDS provides an incredibly rich set of data across multiple decades, the data is split out across different files and formats on the IPEDS [data portal](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx), making it challenging to do anything but the most basic analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "One key thing we've done with `scipeds` is to standardize and centralize this data across multiple years into a single, query-able database. That database file is critical to using `scipeds`, so downloading it is the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll be focusing on IPEDS completions data. That said, we've written `scipeds` in a way that should make it easy to add other survey components like admissions and enrollment. As the package expands, approaches and concepts similar to the ones we share here will apply to these new IPEDS survey components."
